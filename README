Rootin Tootin is a fast RESTful web server and framework written in D. It is 
designed to scale well by default, while still providing a developer experience 
similar to Ruby on Rails.


1. Install the dependencies for your distro:
# ubuntu
sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server libmysqlclient16-dev \
python-mysqldb python-pexpect python-mako python-pyinotify \
build-essential bzr ldc libtango-ldc-dev libpcre3 libpcre3-dev inotify-tools
sudo service mysql start

# fedora
# Install ldc and tango from here:
# http://www.dsource.org/projects/ldc/
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install mysql mysql-server MySQL-python pexpect python-mako python-inotify bzr ldc pcre pcre-devel inotify-tools
sudo service mysqld start

2. Move to your install location, download the code, add path to bashrc:
cd ~
bzr branch lp:rester rootintootin
cd rootintootin
sudo make install


3. Copy the examples to your desktop, to play with:
cp -r examples/ ~/Desktop/examples/
cd ~/Desktop/examples/users


4. Change the site's database user and port:
./gen configure database user:root password:password
./gen configure server port:3000


5. Generate, build, run:
./gen create database
./gen migrate
./run


6. In your web browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/users and you should 
see a basic CRUD example.


7. Now look at the code and start hacking. I will add more formal documentation 
when things are a little more fleshed out.
